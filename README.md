This is the code of our independent evaluation for some existing intepretability methods. This independent evaluation is for our review paper
"On Interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks " (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02522).

The required environment is TensorFlow 1.XX. You may have to download the necessary packages before you run this code. 
For PIPO-FAN code, the saved model named "resunet_checkpoint_final.pth" was not uploaded due to its large size. The complete file can be obtained from Google Drive
