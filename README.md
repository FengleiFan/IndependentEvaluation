This is the code of our independent evaluation for some existing intepretability methods. This independent evaluation is for our review paper
"On Interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks: A Survey " (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02522).

The required environment is TensorFlow 1.XX. You may have to download the necessary packages before you run this code. You can directly run most of code without getting a warning or error except the following one.

1. For PIPO-FAN code, the saved model named "resunet_checkpoint_final.pth" was not uploaded due to its large size. 

2. For Figure 17, you need to download cifar-100 dataset.
